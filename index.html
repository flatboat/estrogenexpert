i want to kill myself.<br>

i am sorry to everyone. <br>
i hate myself more now than i ever have.<br>
i am a walking, talking, living fuck up.<br>
every time i do something good i do something 10 times worse.<br>
i hope i die by the end of the month.<br>
noone will even care.<br>
i have no friends.<br>
i have no family.<br>
i am completely alone in this world.<br>
i have no money to get the help i need.<br>
i have no resources in my area that i know of (and that i could get access to, due to transportation and/or lack of funding)<br>
my life, is over. https://open.spotify.com/track/7seK7cskNRsFmlGXv4Rw5Q?si=3e4a2434776040e8<br>
