      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I'm <span style="color:#b58900">Amber</span>! I'm 23, and have lived in the US my entire life <em>
          <span style="color:#6c71c4">(i hate it here)...</span>
        </em> I mostly play VALORANT and make music to pass my time, however I am always open to finding more things, and people to do them with :) In my past i've struggled with heartbreak, mental health problems, and honestly <em>
          <span style="color:#dc322f">way.... way.... too much to list...</span>
        </em> but, that's not why you're here, <span style="color:#2aa198">right?</span> This is my little.... <span style="color:#F5A9B8">website....</span> I guess? Which means you're probably hear to learn about <em>
          <span style="color:#6c71c4">me....</span>
        </em> Oh lord, where to begin... <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p> I began programming in <span style="color:#2aa198">5th Grade</span>, basically run-of-the-mill webdev front-end stuff, you know how it goes, right? In 2015 I got into <span style="color:#F5A9B8">gamehacking</span>. (think mostly, hvh, cs:go, etc) Honestly I partly regret getting into it, but also a massive part of <span style="color:#5BCEFA">m</span>
        <span style="color:#F5A9B8">y</span>
        <span style="color:white">se</span>
        <span style="color:#F5A9B8">l</span>
        <span style="color:#5BCEFA">f</span> was uncovered due to the experiences and people I met during those times. I've always had an ear for <span style="color:#859900">music</span>, I was in band class going into middle-school, I played trumpet, piano, and guitar :3 <br>
      </p>
      <p> During my childhood I didn't know what a <span style="color:#F5A9B8">'trans'</span> person was... which left me <span style="color:#9c0000">alone.... and afraid...</span> I was too <span style="color:#F5A9B8">girly</span> to play sports, but too <span style="color:#5BCEFA">boyish</span> to do plays and acting... I'd play with barbie dolls then go outside and play football... I've never really <span style='color:#009c5e'>'fit in'</span>. I'd <em>
          <span style="color:coral">pray</span>
        </em> to wake up as a girl in second grade, only to be disappointed. I even went around telling my peers I was a girl... if only I had known. Life comes at you abruptly, and for 22 years of my life I was, <em>
          <span style="color:#78a3ff">'him'</span>
        </em>, well.... now i'm finally <em>
          <span style="color:#F5A9B8">me</span>
        </em>. </p>
      <p> If you're a likeminded person just looking to make friends, or talk about life, hit me up! I'm into pretty much everything so I'm sure we have some common interests :3 </p>
