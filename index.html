i want to kill myself.
i am sorry to everyone. 
i hate myself more now than i ever have.
i am a walking, talking, living fuck up.
every time i do something good i do something 10 times worse.
i hope i die by the end of the month.
noone will even care.
i have no friends.
i have no family.
i am completely alone in this world.
i have no money to get the help i need.
i have no resources in my area that i know of (and that i could get access to, due to transportation and/or lack of funding)

my life, is over.
